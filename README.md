# Demographic Profiles of Ontario
### By Jong Lee
#### August 27, 2019

This project was intended to scrape demographic details of all census subdivisions of Ontario from Statistics Canada's 2016 Census Profile.

I have used Scrapy in Python to parse all the links that correspond to different census subdivisions in the base url and extracted specific information (e.g. population, gender ratio, income..etc) from the resulting database tables.

The goal of this project is to create a city profile dashboard to help people make informed decisions about each demographic regions in Ontario.

Attached is a Python script to demonstrate how I have approached this project.
